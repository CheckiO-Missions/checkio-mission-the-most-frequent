        Try to create a variable, for example, 'max_count' and overwrite it every time
        when you comparing the amounts of 2 elements and find which of them is the most frequent.

    <div class="answer">
        Your code may look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
        def most_frequent(data):
            max_count = 0
            for i in data:
                if data.count(i) > max_count:
                    max_count = data.count(i)
                    max_value = i
            return max_value</pre>
    </div>
