    <div class="answer">
        You need to find an element one of the parameters of which is <b>maximal</ b> (in this case it’s frequency).
        For these types of cases Python has a great built-in 
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max'>max() function</a>.

    <div class="question">
        How exactly does this function work? Can you give an example?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Let’s assume we have a list of numbers - [2, 7, 6, 14, -1, 10.5, -1, 5]. If we use the max function, 
        we'll get the number 14 - the maximum element of the list.
        Code will be as follows:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def most_frequent(data):
    return max(data)</pre>
    </div>
</div>
    
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        But we need to find the element with the maximum frequency. What should I do in this case?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For this you need to additionally use the 'key' parameter inside the 'max' function, with which you can find
        the maximum element not by the absolute value, but, for example, by the frequency.
        In this case the 
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists'>list.count() method</a> will be useful.

    <div class="question">
        Can I see the full version of the code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Code that solves this task fits into a one-line function:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def most_frequent(data):
    return max(data, key=lambda a: data.count(a))</pre>
        Which can be written even simpler:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def most_frequent(data):
    return max(data, key=data.count)</pre>
        This function will do exactly what we need: count how many times each element enters the input
        list (key=data.count is responsible for this), and then the max function itself will use this parameter (the frequency) to determine
        the required element.
