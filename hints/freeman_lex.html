        You need to find an element one of the parameters of which is <b>maximal</b> (in this case it’s frequency).
        For these types of cases Python has a great built-in 
        <a target="_blank" href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max'>max()</a> function.

    <div class="question">
        How exactly does this function work? Can you give an example?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Let’s assume you have {% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}an Array{% else %}a list{% endif %} of numbers - [2, 7, 6, 14, -1, 10.5, -1, 5].
        If we use the max function, we'll get the number 14 - the maximum element
        of the list. Code will be as follows:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
data = [2, 7, 6, 14, -1, 10.5, -1, 5]
max(data)
>>> 14
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        But I need to find the element with the maximum frequency. What should I do in this case?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For this you need to additionally use the 'key' parameter inside the 'max'
        function, with which you can find the maximum element not by the absolute
        value, but, for example, by the frequency. In this case the list
        <a target="_blank" href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists'>count()</a> method will be useful.

    <div class="question">
        Can I see the full version of the code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Code that solves this task fits into a one-line function:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def most_frequent(data: list[str]) -> str:

    return max(data, key=lambda a: data.count(a))
        </pre>
        Which can be written even simpler:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def most_frequent(data: list[str]) -> str:

    return max(data, key=data.count)
        </pre>
        This function will do exactly what you need: count how many times each
        element enters the input list (key=data.count is responsible for this),
        and then the max function itself will use this parameter (the frequency)
        to determine the required element.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are a lot of other solutions you be able to see after your solution
        passes all tests successfully. For example:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from statistics import mode as most_frequent
        </pre>
        Or the longer clear way by comparing frequencies in a loop:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def most_frequent(data: list[str]) -> str:

    answer = 0, ''
    for var in set(data):
        freq = data.count(var)
        if  freq > answer[0]:
            answer = freq, var

    return answer[1]
        </pre>
    </div>

        Thanks! I know and understand more now. Everything works fine!
